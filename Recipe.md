### Description
This is a recipe for tau huay suitable for use with ingredients found locally in the U.S., specifically for Cambridge, MA.  
This recipe creates a tau huay with a more traditional texture as opposed to Lao Ban's style of tau huay. Traditional texture can be achieved by setting soy milk with GDL (glucono delta-lactone) or gypsum (a.k.a calcium sulfate, 石膏粉), while Lao Ban's style can be achieve by setting with carrageenan (a.k.a RED MAN's Instant Jelly Powder).  
Unlike tau hauy made directly from raw soy beans (out of scope of this recipe), this recipe uses soy milk as the starting ingredient, sacrificing some freshness and control for convenience. When starting with soy milk, a critical parameter is its level of dilution.  
Unsweetened soy milk tend to diluted less than than sweetened soy milk. This is deduced by reading the declared "Nutrition Facts" and assuming that all the declared protein comes from soy proteins. Commercial soy milk tends to diluted compared to homemade soy milk and most soy milk have a soy concentration too low to be set properly. Fortunately, some unsweetened soy milk are above the settable threshold for this recipe to work.

### Ingredients
##### Boil in pot
 - 1000g Kong Kee's refrigerated unsweetened soybean milk (2.9% protein level)  
 - 0g water (dilute if using strong soy milk such as Chang Shing's unsweetened soy milk at 4.1% w/w protein level)  
 - 30±5g sugar  
 - a few slices of frozen pandan leaves (optional)  

##### Setting solution
 - 1.74±0.05g GDL  
 - 40±10g water  
   
##### For syrup
 - 40g white sugar  
 - 40g water  
 - 1 ginger slice (optional)  

### Procedures
Prepare setting solution by dissolving GDL in water.  

Bring soy milk with 1 pandan leaf and sugar to a gentle boil, or about 97±2°C. 
 - There is no need to vigorously boil soy milk if not starting from raw soy beans.  
 - Take care to watch the soy milk during boiling to avoid the soy foam from overflowing the pot.  

Pour both setting solution and hot soy milk into some larger container in two intersecting streams for mixing.
 - Try not to pour into the center of the larger container so as to prevent the final solution from continuing to swirl after the pouring. In other words, avoid imparting net angular momentum into the final solution. A swirling solution interferes with undisturbed setting.
 - Setting timescale is about 5 minutes for GDL and 20s for gypsum. Complete setting takes longer.

Cover with moist cloth and lid, and let set, taking care to set for about 45 minutes or longer.
 - It is fine to let set for 90 minutes with no consequences.
 - Setting for a shorter time (for GDL) seems to make the tau huay taste sour (unverified).  
 - Moist cloth is needed to avoid condensation on the lid from falling back onto the soy milk surface and disturbing the setting.

While waiting for the set, dissolve sugar in water for the syrup. Once set, scoop tau huay with thin metal ladle into bowl and add syrup for serving.
